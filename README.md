## Deployment
Deployment is done locally at the moment, to both my dev environment, and production. Source can be either local, or what's in GitHub master branch.

### Development
**dev.ethanmotion.com**. This is my pre-production website, which is restricted to my personal IP address.

### Production
**ethanmotion.com** and **www.ethanmotion.com**. These are my production websites, which are open to the internet.
